["Allow me to introduce myself: Sir Isaac Newton,\nthe discoverer of the laws of mechanics.\nI humbly present an exhibition on the art of equilibrating a text-managed cartpole.\nThis apparatus consists of a carriage that moves freely to and fro,\nwith an elongated pole perched atop that necessitates balancing.\nThe task at hand is to maintain the pole's vertical orientation by exerting forces\nto the left when it falls to the left and to the right when it falls to the right.\nIn essence, the joint's powerlessness impels the pole to cling to a carriage that\ntravels along an unresisting pathway. The pendulum is situated uprightly\non the carriage, and balance is maintained by applying forces in the leftward\nand rightward directions upon the carriage. The angle of the pole is\nthe primary quantity to control, followed by the angular velocity of the pole.\nThe state of the carriage is described in the subsequent manner:\ncart-position: [left-limit|left|center|right|right-limit]\ncart-velocity: [leftwards|stopped|rightwards]\npole-angular-velocity: [leftwards|zero|rightwards]\npole-angle: [far-left|left|upright|right|far-right]\nThe control of the cart is described as follows:\npush-cart: [left|right]\nUpon observing the pole's inclination towards the right,\nI shall apply a force towards the right on the cart to establish the pole's vertical position,\nand conversely for the leftward inclination. With due respect,\nI shall sequentially iterate through the states and controls to demonstrate\nthe art of stabilizing the pole angle upright.
